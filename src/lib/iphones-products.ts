        iPhone 13 features a cinema standard wide color gamut, displaying colors just as filmmakers intended. And with precise color accuracy, everything on the screen looks remarkably natural
        The lightning-fast A15 Bionic powers Cinematic mode, Photographic Styles, Live Text, and more. Its Secure Enclave locks down personal info like your Face ID data and contacts. And it’s more efficient, helping to deliver longer battery life.
        We designed a totally new architecture and turned the lenses 45 degrees to fit in our best dual-camera system ever — with its biggest Wide camera sensor. We also made room for our sensor-shift optical image stabilization. And we equipped the Ultra-Wide camera with a faster sensor.
